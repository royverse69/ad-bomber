ULTRA Ad-Blocker Stress Test - Memory Optimized
USER WARNINGS AND INFORMATION

WARNING: This tool is HIGHLY resource-intensive and may cause system issues, including crashes, slowdowns, or data loss. Read this document carefully before proceeding. Use at your own risk.

1. WHAT THIS TOOL DOES
   - Simulates 50,000+ tracking elements (pixels, scripts, iframes) to test ad-blocker performance.
   - Generates heavy CPU, memory, and network load to mimic aggressive online tracking.
   - Includes memory optimization to clean up elements, but still demands significant resources.

2. POSSIBLE RISKS
   - HIGH CPU USAGE: May max out your processor, slowing or freezing your system.
   - MEMORY INTENSIVE: Can use 2-8GB of RAM, potentially causing crashes on low-memory devices.
   - BROWSER CRASHES: May freeze or crash your browser, especially on low-end systems.
   - NETWORK LOAD: Generates thousands of HTTP-like requests, possibly using 100+ MB of bandwidth.
   - SYSTEM SLOWDOWN: Other applications may become unresponsive during the test.
   - BATTERY DRAIN: Rapidly depletes battery on laptops or mobile devices.
   - DATA USAGE: Consumes significant bandwidth if network requests aren't blocked.
   - CRASH RISK: Low-end devices (e.g., <4GB RAM) may experience system or browser crashes.
   - POTENTIAL DATA LOSS: If your system crashes, unsaved work in other applications may be lost.

3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
   - Powerful computer with 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended).
   - Modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
   - Ad-blocker installed (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus) for testing.
   - All important work saved before running the test.
   - Avoid running on mobile devices due to battery and performance issues.

4. HOW TO USE SAFELY
   - Save all work in other applications before starting.
   - Enable your ad-blocker to block simulated tracking requests.
   - Run on a desktop or laptop, not a mobile device.
   - Close unnecessary applications to free up resources.
   - Monitor system performance (e.g., Task Manager on Windows, Activity Monitor on macOS).
   - Click "CANCEL - TOO RISKY" or close the browser to stop the test if issues arise.
   - Consider running in a controlled environment (e.g., with network blocked via firewall).

5. INSTRUCTIONS
   1. Open index.html in your browser.
   2. Read the on-screen warnings about risks.
   3. Click "I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS - START TEST" to begin (starts after a 5-second countdown).
   4. Watch real-time stats: generated elements, active elements, cleaned elements, memory usage.
   5. Test completes automatically, showing "ULTRA BOMBARDMENT COMPLETE" and max active elements.
   6. To stop early, click "CANCEL - TOO RISKY" or close the browser.

6. IMPORTANT NOTES
   - For legitimate ad-blocker testing only. Misuse may violate terms of service of websites or networks.
   - Memory usage stats are only available in some browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
   - Network requests may be blocked by ad-blockers or browser security, which is normal.
   - If your system becomes unresponsive, force-close the browser or restart your device.
   - Not recommended for devices with less than 4GB RAM or older processors.
